Sugo project layout
===================

Detailed description of the layout of the project.

A single Makefile
-----------------
A single Makefile situated in the root of the project directory structure serves the purpose of describing targets and dependencies for the entire source code base.

The Makefile uses the GNU Make syntax.


Documentation
-------------
In the root of the project's layout, README and PROJECT (this document) form the basis for the documentation.

Each directory found within this project has a README file which must be read in order to familiarise one self with the contents.

Each file is described in FILES so that by looking at FILES a quick reference can be established.

Look at TODO for a list of things to do next.
