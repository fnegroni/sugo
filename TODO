TODO
====

. Implement tests as three queues: one for pending, running and executed.
.. The queues are independent and we use functions to make sure we encapsulate as much as possible away from the logic. That's what functions are there for.
.. So a test exists in three queues and the operation to pass one test from a queue to another is encapsulated by a function too.
.. Queues are like linked lists, exept with only two operations: push at end and pop at front. that's all.

. Implement input/output redirection for each test

. Ensure printing of status breakdown

. Write manual page

. Implement data structures using libcini itself
